        Hi. Bamidele here. I graduated from ABU Zaria in 2011 & did my NYSC
        program in the Northwestern part of the country in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got a good job almost immediately after completing my NYSC even though
        I already had a running business venture.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider myself "lucky" since I never had to experience unemployment
        or joblessness like many other uni graduates in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Escaping joblessness & unemployment didn't just happen out of nowhere
        for me. There were certain and specific moves I made while in uni that
        were extremely helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write posts on UNI201 because I want to share those moves so you too
        can excape joblessness and unemployment after you graduate.
      </p>
