        I graduated from ABU Zaria in 2011 & did my NYSC program in the
        Northwestern part of the country in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        Got employed as a lecturer almost immediately after completing my NYSC
        while running a simple business venture.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider myself "lucky" because I have never experienced unemployment
        or joblessness before like many other uni graduates in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Escaping unemployment after graduation didn't just happen out of the
        blue for me. There were deliberate moves I made while in uni that were
        extremely helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I post about the moves I made and other thoughtful lessons on UNI201 (
        <a href="https://uni201.com.ng" class="text-cyan-700 hover:opacity-60">
          uni201.com.ng
        </a>
        ) so you too can excape joblessness and unemployment after you graduate.
