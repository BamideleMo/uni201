        I graduated from ABU Zaria in 2011 & did my NYSC program in the
        Northwestern part of the country in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        Got employed as a lecturer almost immediately after completing my NYSC
        while running a business venture.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider myself "lucky" since I never had to experience
        unemployment/joblessness like many other uni graduates in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Escaping unemployment almost immediately after graduation didn't just
        happen out of the blue for me. There were deliberate moves I made while
        in uni that were extremely helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write posts on UNI201 because I want to share those moves so you too
        can excape joblessness and unemployment after you graduate.
